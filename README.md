This repository demonstrates a common SQL error involving the comparison of nullable columns.  The `bug.sql` file contains a query that unintentionally omits rows with `NULL` values in a comparison. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides a corrected version that handles `NULL` values appropriately.  This example highlights the need to carefully handle `NULL` values when writing SQL queries, particularly when using comparison operators like `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=`. Always consider the potential for `NULL` values and adjust your queries accordingly.
